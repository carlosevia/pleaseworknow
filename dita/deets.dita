Their food and pastry selection is great and in a wide variety. There is nothing too special about the seating, but there is plenty of it if you want to take a few moments to enjoy. However, the farm where Deet's sources their milk is across from the Radford Army Ammunition Plant, which dispels thousands of toxins each year. For this reason, I have docked their rating a point. If you visit this shop, which I still recommend you do, I encourage you to choose a milk other than cow's.</p></section></body></topic>
